- Ever feel like something is missing? Like you're unsure of where you're headed?

- Look around you: the sun, the moon, the sky, the earth, the oceans. Then look at yourself: you started as a sperm, grew into a baby, and became the man you are today.

- Do you feel like there's something bigger at play?

- Have you ever asked yourself, Who created all of this? or What is expected of me?

-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abd Alrahman Atieh (Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø­Ù…Ù† Ø¹Ø·ÙŠØ©).

- Iâ€™ve found the answers to these questions, and they drive my purpose in life.

- I work hard every day to fulfill that purpose, believing that life without challenges would be boring.
